update-manager
==============

Gnome Shell Extension to display Software Updates in the Panel.

This extension uses PackageKit bindings to talk to the Software Backend,
and should be more or less portable across all distributions which have a
PackageKit frontend.

I will personally test it only with openSUSE and Ubuntu.
