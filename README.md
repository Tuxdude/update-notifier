===============

Gnome Shell Extension to display Software Updates in the Panel.

This extension uses PackageKit bindings to talk to the Software Backend,
and should be more or less portable across all distributions which have a
PackageKit frontend.

I personally test this shell extension with only openSUSE and Ubuntu. It
should ideally work with other distributions as well, and I'm open to fixing
such issues if reported.
